# xwoba_models
There are multiple approaches to modelling xwOBA. I used k-nearest neighbors as the model and total bases as the target variable. KNN was used to predict the probabilities of the different total bases classes. After that I used the probabilities and multiplied them by their respective wOBA weight. Lastly, I measured the correlation between my xwOBA metric and the official one by MLB and found a correlation of 0.95. I would have liked it to be a bit closer to 1, but with some model changes I should be able to get closer. Plus, MLB uses sprint speed on certain hit types in their model, which I did not do in this project.
